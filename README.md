# URL Shortener Microservice

A Python Flask application that generates and resolves shortened URLs. Designed to explore backend development, REST API design, and lightweight database integration. The service stores mappings between original and shortened URLs, returning redirect responses on access.

## Current Features
- Create and retrieve shortened URLs through RESTful endpoints
- Redirect users to original URLs via unique short codes
- Uses SQLite for persistent data storage
- Basic input validation and error handling

## Planned Features
- Add user accounts and authentication
- Track click counts and timestamps for analytics
- Deploy on Render or AWS Lambda
- Create simple frontend interface for link submission

## Tech Stack
Python 3.12 | Flask | SQLite | REST API | HTTP | JSON

## Status
In Progress – Core API endpoints functional; deployment and analytics in progress.

## What I’m Learning
Building RESTful APIs with Flask, integrating lightweight databases for persistence, and managing HTTP routing and redirect logic.
